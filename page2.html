    <p>
      The difference between block level elements and inline elements in HTML is
      in how they are displayed on a webpage. Block elements like div and p take
      up the full width of available space and always starts on a new line
      stacking vertically. This means they create a block of content pushing as
      much width as needed, by pushing other elements to the next line. On the
      other hand, inline elements like span and a only, use as much width as
      needed and do not start on a new line. This allows multiple inline
      elements to sit side by side within the same block. This distinct
      difference helps structure and style webpages and makes content more
      organized and managable.

          <th>Inline</th>
          <th>Block</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Use as much width as needed</td>
          <td>Uses full width</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
